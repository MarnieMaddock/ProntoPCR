Description: ProntoPCR is a software application that aims to efficiently and automatically perform routine qPCR calculations, such as averaging the housekeeper genes, calculating ΔCq, ΔΔCq, relative fold-change (2^-ΔCq), and fold-change (2^-ΔΔCq) of the target gene. It also provides the user with options to perform statistics and graphing of the data. ProntoPCR is an open-source, R shiny software application available both online and locally as an R package. It is also designed to be compatible with the output generated by PCR machines, such as the Quantstudio 5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) enabling the user to get instant results. Users only require a comma separated values (.csv) file of the raw data, including the quantification cycle (Cq) values, the target (gene) and sample name to get started.
