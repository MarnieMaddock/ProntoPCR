    "text": "ProntoPCR is a software application that aims to perform routine qPCR calculations efficiently and automatically, such as averaging the housekeeper genes, calculating ΔCq, ΔΔCq, relative fold-change (2^-ΔCq), and fold-change (2^-ΔΔCq) of the target gene. It also provides the user with options to perform statistics and graphing of the data. ProntoPCR is an open-source, R shiny (Chang et al., 2024) software application available both online and locally as an R package (R Core Team., 2013), making it accessible to users with minimal programming experience. It is also designed to be compatible with the output generated by PCR machines, such as the Quantstudio 5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) enabling the user to get instant results. Users only require a comma separated values (.csv) file of the raw data, including the quantification cycle (Cq) values, the target (gene) and sample name to get started.\nWe request that users of ProntoPCR cite the associated journal article if the application has been used in analysis. The citation is as follows:\n\n\nInstructions for Use\nProntoPCR has been designed to operate both online and locally. While we aim to maintain online availability, the hosted platform may change or become unavailable. Note the online application times out after 5 minutes of inactivity. Therefore, it is recommended to rely on the local version, which functions with the same features as the online option. The local version also does not require internet access once installed.\nTo run the application locally, the user needs to download R and RStudio. A step-by-step guide on how to install the ProntoPCR application locally can be found in the Getting Started – Local Access tab. This guide is aimed at users with minimal programming expertise.\nOnline access instructions are available in the Getting Started – Online Access section."

This provides a measure of how spread out the data points are within each group.Variance is calculated as:\n\\[\nS^2 = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n - 1}\n\\]\nWhere:\n- \\(S^2\\) is the sample variance\n- \\(∑\\) denotes the summation over all observations - \\(x_i\\) is each individual observation\n- \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the mean of the observations\n- n is the number of observations\n- n - 1 is the degrees of freedom\n\n\nMinimum and Maximum\nThe minimum and maximum values are determined by identifying the smallest and largest valid data points for each group.\n\nExample results:"

If one-way ANOVA is selected, the normality tests will be performed on the residuals, not the raw data. A Residuals vs Fitted plot will also be displayed if One-way ANOVA and a normality test are both selected. The raw values are the default if no comparison of groups test, or any other group comparison tests are selected. Note that normality testing is usually considered to be unreliable for small sample sizes.\n\nShapiro-Wilk Test\nA Shapiro-Wilk test can be performed by selecting the checkbox on the side panel.\n\nRaw data:\n\n\n\nResiduals:\n\n\n\n\nQQ Plot\nA QQ Plot will be generated by selecting the checkbox on the side panel.\n\n\n\nDensity Plot\nA density plot will be generated by selecting the ‘Density Plot’ checkbox on the side panel."

For PCR data, it is recommended to use log2() transformations, however, log10() is given as an additional option if there are large differences in expression. If log2 or log10 is selected, all statistics will be performed on the transformed values e.g. log2(2^-ΔΔCq). Log transformation may help with normalizing data and reducing skewness. Note log transforming data points = 0 will return NA. To perform a log transformation, select Log2 or Log10 in the side panel. Any selected statistics will be performed on the log-transformed data when selected."

The chosen calculation (i.e. 2-(ΔCq) or 2-(ΔΔCq)), samples and gene must be identical in the Statistics and Graphs tab for the correct p-values to be plotted. Error messages (Discrepancy detected) will appear if the options do not match, and will prompt the user to alter the selection. If the graph is empty, it may mean that a discrepancy was detected and needs to be changed for the graph to generate.
