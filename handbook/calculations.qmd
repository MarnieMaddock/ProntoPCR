Description of terms and formulas used in qPCR calculations within ProntoPCR.

|  **Term**            | **ProntoPCR Alias**  | **Formula/Explanation** |
| :------------------- | :------------- | :---------------------- |
| Housekeeper Average | mean_hk             | = Mean(Housekeeper Gene<sub> *1*</sub>, Housekeeper Gene<sub> *n*</sub>)  |
| ΔCq (Delta Cq)      | dcq_gene            | = Cq (Gene of Interest) - Cq (Housekeeper Average) |
| 2^-(ΔCq) (Relative Fold Change) |  fc_dcq_gene | = 2^-(ΔCq) |
| ΔCq Control Average    | dcq_ctrl_avg | The average ΔCq value for the control group for the selected gene. Used for ΔΔCq calculations   |
| ΔΔCq (Delta Delta Cq) | ddcq_gene | = ΔCq (Gene of Interest) - ΔCq (Control Average) |
| 2^-(ΔΔCq) (Fold Change) | fc_ddcq_gene | = 2^-(ΔΔCq) |


The 2^-ΔCq calculations will auto populate with the data from the Input Data Tab. The 2^ΔΔCq requires the user to specify a few more inputs before the calculations can be performed. For both calculations, the average of the housekeeper genes will automatically be calculated using arithmetic mean. This is within the 2^-(ΔCq) tab. This will be displayed as the mean_hk column on the right. E.g. the mean_hk for sample1_1_F is calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{mean}_{\text{hk}} &= \frac{29.0352 + 20.6732 + 23.1307}{3} \\
                        &= 24.2797
\end{aligned}
$$

To use geometric mean, select this option on the side panel:

The geometric mean is calculated as follows for sample1_1_F:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Product} &= 29.0352 \times 20.6732 \times 23.1307 = 13{,}884.29033 \\
N_{\text{housekeepers}} &= 3 \\
\text{Geometric mean} &= \sqrt[3]{\text{Product}}
                       = \sqrt[3]{13{,}884.29033} \\
                      &\approx 24.03483
\end{aligned}

## 2^-(ΔCq)

The ΔCq is calculated as follows:

::: {.gray-box}
 ΔCq = Cq (gene of interest) – Cq (average of the housekeeping genes)
