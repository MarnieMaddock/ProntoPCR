ProntoCPR has been downloaded, but it has not been loaded into the R session. To do this, type this line of code in the Console and press control/command enter to run it:

::: gray-box
```
library(ProntoPCR)
```
:::

This itself will not open the application. To open the application, run:

::: gray-box
```
ProntoPCR()
```
:::

This should open the ProntoPCR app in a new window. If not, the http address given in your console following “Listening on” can be copied into a web browser to open ProntoPCR.
